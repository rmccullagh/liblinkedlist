libtool version

current
The most recent interface number that this library implements.

revision
The implementation number of the current interface.

age
The difference between the newest and oldest interfaces that this library implements. 
In other words, the library implements all the interface numbers in the range from number 
current - age to current.

If two libraries have identical current and age numbers, then the dynamic linker chooses 
the library with the greater revision number.
